            <p>This course is an introduction to computer science and
            programming as a basis for understanding computation. We
            will work with the Processing language, a flexible language
            for coding in the context of the visual arts, as well as a
            foundational tool for learning programming skills. This
            course will be adaptive to student needs for those within
            and outside of the Computer Science Major. We will begin the
            semester learning basic elements of programming along with
            coding skills and concepts. As the semester progresses
            students will propose and work on individual programming
            projects to demonstrate their knowledge and to apply
            concepts of computation to their own areas of interest and
            study.</p>
