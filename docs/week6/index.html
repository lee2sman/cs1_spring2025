            <h2 id="classes-and-objects">Classes and Objects</h2>
            <p>Processing (and Java) are <strong>Object-oriented
            programming</strong>.</p>
            <p>Objects have properties.</p>
            <p>I am a person. I have hair color, age, name, height, for
            example.</p>
            <p>You are a person. You have your own hair color, age,
            name, height.</p>
            <p>We have the same variables names. But my hair color, age,
            name, height are different from yours, and different from
            other people’s.</p>
            <p><strong>Objects have their own instances of variables and
            functions (methods)</strong></p>
            <h2 id="what-is-a-class">What is a class?</h2>
            <p>In a programming language, a <em>class</em> is a defined
            code template that is used to create objects. We say that
            classes <em>encapsulate</em> objects. In other words, they
            enclose all of the variables and functions needed for each
            object.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>They store functions and variables together</li>
            <li>A class is a template - a <em>cookie-cutter</em></li>
            <li>They are used to <em>stamp out</em> individual
            Objects</li>
            <li>When we stamp out or create an object using the
            Class/cookie cutter we are said to be <em>instantiating</em>
            an object. Each object is an <em>instance</em> of the
            class.</li>
            <li>Each time you use the class to create a new object
            instance, it will have its own variables and functions
            assigned to it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>My Class name is People</p>
            <p>I have an instance of People with the variable name Carl.
            Carl’s <code>first_last</code> is Carl Winslow. Carl’s
            <code>height</code> is 68 (we may know this to be inches). I
            have another instance of People with the variable name
            Steve. Steve’s <code>first_last</code> is Steve_Urkel.
            Steve’s <code>height</code> is 71. Both have the same
            associated attributes (which we can think of as associated
            variables) but they each have their OWN that are independent
            from each other.</p>
            <h3
            id="to-learn-about-objects-we-are-going-to-create-frogger">To
            learn about objects, we are going to create Frogger</h3>
            <p>with a single Frog class and a Car class. There will be
            many cars, each with their own x,y,color,and xspeed.</p>
            <h4 id="how-to-write-a-class">How to write a class</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>example taken from Daniel Shiffman, Learning
            Processing</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>void setup(){

}

void draw(){

}

//note that by convention we capitalize a class name
class Car {

}</code></pre>
            <h4 id="lets-create-a-class">Let’s create a class</h4>
            <p>We create a new object with the <code>new</code>
            operator.</p>
            <p>main structure of our program:</p>
            <pre><code>Car myCar; //declares an object myCar of type Car

void setup(){
  myCar = newCar(); //this is the object initialization.
}

void draw(){
    background(255);
    myCar.move();
    myCar.display();
}</code></pre>
            <p>By convention, we place our classes in their own tab in
            Processing. Click the New Tab, and name the file with the
            class name. When you save your Processing program it will
            save your code from all of the tabs.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that when you are looking at one tab and hit
            the compile/run button it will also compile and run the code
            from your other tabs even though you can’t see them all open
            simultaneously.</p>
            <p>It is recommended to keep your global variables, setup,
            draw on the first tab, and generally our user-defined
            functions. Place your Class definitions on other tabs.</p>
            <p>Let’s create our Car class. Open a new tab. Now add:</p>
            <pre><code>class Car {

  color c;
  float xpos;
  float ypos;
  float xspeed;

  Car() {
    c = color(255);
    xpos = width/2;
    ypos = height/2;
    xspeed = 1;
  }

  void display() {
    //The car is just a rectangle
    rectMode(CENTER);
    fill(c);
    rect(xpos, ypos, 20, 10);
  }

  void move(){
    xpos = xpos + xspeed;
    if (xpos &gt; width){
      xpos = 0;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
            <h3 id="objects-with-arguments">Objects with arguments</h3>
            <p>When you pass in a variable when you call a function, you
            are technically passing in the value of the variable at that
            moment.</p>
            <p>Objects work differently. When you supply an argument to
            an object created with a class, you create a temporary
            reference to stand in for the variable you will be passing
            in.</p>
            <p><em>from Learning Processing</em></p>
            <pre><code>Frog f; //declares an object f of type Frog

void setup(){
    f = new Frog(100); //100 goes into tempTongueLength
}

class Frog{
  int tongueLength; //creates an instance variable

  Frog (int tempTongueLength){ //temporary local variable
      tongueLength = tempTongueLength; //assigns the value to tongueLength
  }
}</code></pre>
            <h3
            id="question-when-do-you-use-a-classobject-versus-when-do-you-use-a-function">Question:
            When do you use a class/object versus when do you use a
            function?</h3>
            <h2 id="homework-programming">Homework Programming</h2>
            <p>Build off the work we did in class to finish your
            Frogger-derived game. You can make your game more or less
            difficult depending on the speed. Consider the speed of the
            frog, and of the cars. It is okay to deviate from the
            classic Frogger gameplay and make your own version (in fact,
            it’s encouraged). Use functions, classes and objects. Pay
            attention to functionality. Make the game a challenge, but
            make it playable. Use variables.</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Make a frog class and a car class.</li>
            <li>Use the arrow keys to control the frog.</li>
            <li>check if the frog has hit a car. If so, move the frog
            back to the start at the bottom of the screen. Hint:
            Consider how we checked whether the pong ball was on top of
            the rectangle. Use that knowledge to check whether the frog
            has hit a car. Add a checkForCollision() function inside
            your Car class and use on each car instance.</li>
            <li>Add a score and lives. Start with 3 lives. If the frog
            gets hit 3 times, end the game. (background black and
            noLoop() ). Each time the frog gets to the top, add 1 to the
            score and start the frog over again from the bottom. When
            you die, print out the final score with println().</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Make sure you break your code into modular functions. Add
            comments so that I (and you) can read and understand your
            code.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Optional challenge: Add a countdown timer so that you
            have limited time to get to the other side. Each time you
            successfully cross (or get hit by a car and start over),
            reset the timer.</li>
            <li>Optional challenge for CS/M and advanced students: Add a
            gameplay dynamic so that the game gets harder each time you
            reach the other side.</li>
            </ul>
