            <p>In previous classes we talked about coding iteratively.
            Iteration is the process of repeating steps over and over.
            Sometimes when we code we want to repeat an action again and
            again. Sometimes when we code we want to repeat an action
            again and again. Sometimes when we code we want to repeat an
            action again and again. Sometimes when we code we want to
            repeat an action again and again.</p>

            <h3 id="local-vs-global-variables">Local vs Global
            variables</h3>
            <p>So far when we have written variables we have been
            declaring them at the top of our program before our
            <code>setup()</code>. When we create variables this way we
            are creating <em>global</em> variables. Like the name global
            implies, these are variables that can be used everywhere, at
            any time. They are the easiest variables to use.</p>
            <p>In addition to global variables are local variables. To
            understand what this is, it’s important to understand what
            we mean by the term <em>block</em> of code. In programming,
            sections of our code can be broken down into chunks or
            blocks. The code inside of <code>setup(){ }</code> is a
            block of code. So is the code inside <code>draw(){  }</code>
            and the code inside <code>mousePressed(){</code>.</p>
            <h4 id="tldr">TL;DR</h4>
            <p>Variables declared inside a block are local! They can
            only be used inside that function.</p>
            <p>Put your global variables at the top before setup!</p>
            <p>Variables declared outside a function block are global.
            They can be be used by all functions.</p>
            <p><em>More info on local vs global variables can be found
            in your book in Chapter 6 Section 5.</em></p>
            <h3 id="building-a-more-complex-program-pong">Building a
            more complex program: Pong</h3>
            <p>We’ll build off our previous work with a ball that wraps
            around our screen to turn it into a basic version of
            Pong.</p>
            <h4 id="wrapping">Wrapping</h4>
            <p>How do we detect that our ball is off the screen? We need
            to look at its x and y position. We can break this down into
            4 checks with if statements.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>If our ball is offscreen to the left (the x position is
            what?)</li>
            <li>If our ball is offscreen to the right (the x position is
            what?)</li>
            <li>If our ball is offscreen to the top (the y position is
            what?)</li>
            <li>If our ball is offscreen to the bottom (the y position
            is what?)</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>if (x &gt; width){ //if our ball&#39;s x is offscreen to the right
  x = 0; //then we reset it to the left side of the screen
}</code></pre>
            <p>We can do this for all four sides.</p>
            <h4 id="bouncing">Bouncing</h4>
            <p>Now that we have our 4 if statements to detect if we have
            hit the edge of the screen, we can modify our code to have
            the ball bounce instead of wrap.</p>
            <p>To do this, we need to modify our ball’s movement.</p>
            <p>How do we move our ball to the right?</p>
            <pre><code>x = x + 1;</code></pre>
            <p>What if we want to move left?</p>
            <pre><code>x = x - 1;</code></pre>
            <p>We can make a variable called xspeed that can change at
            different times.</p>
            <pre><code>float x = 100;
float xspeed = 1;
  
void draw(){
  x = x + xspeed

  if (x &gt; width){ //if offscreen to the right
    xspeed = xspeed * -1; 
    //flips our xspeed between a negative and positive number
  }
}</code></pre>
            <p>We also want to have the ball flip direction if it goes
            offscreen to the left.</p>
            <pre><code>if (x &lt; 0){ //if offscreen to the left
    xspeed = xspeed * -1; 
    //flips our xspeed between a negative and positive number
}</code></pre>
            <p>This code is almost exactly the same.</p>
            <p>It’s best practice to combine them together.</p>
            <pre><code>if ((x &gt; width) || (x &lt; 0)){
    xspeed = xspeed * -1; 
    //flips our xspeed between a negative and positive number
}</code></pre>
            <p>We can do this for the ball’s y value as well. <em>See
            uploaded starter pong code for example</em>.</p>
            <h4 id="controlling-the-player">Controlling the player</h4>
            <p>We can use keyPressed() function to detect key
            presses.</p>
            <pre><code>void keyPressed(){
  if (key == CODED){
    if (keyCode == UP){
      println(&quot;you&#39;ve pressed up&quot;);
      //code to move up goes here
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
            <p>The variable keyCode is used to detect special keys such
            as the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT) as well as
            ALT, CONTROL, and SHIFT. Info from the reference page on <a
            href="https://processing.org/reference/keyCode.html">keyCode</a>.</p>
            <p>When working with keyCodes it is useful to first check to
            make sure a key is coded. We do this by nesting our code
            inside an if statement to make sure the key is coded.</p>
            <p>How do you move the player up? Decrease the player’s Y.
            And vice versa for moving down.</p>

            <h2 id="pong-part-1">Pong: Part 1</h2>
            <p>We’re building out <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiShX2pTz9A">Pong</a>
            over two weeks. We’ll start with a 1 player version.</p>
            <p>You should probably do these in order. Try to get as many
            of them implemented as you can.</p>
            <p>The screen size is 600 by 400.</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Get your ball to bounce around the screen. Make sure
            that when the ball hits a side it bounces. The ball should
            start with a random x-speed and y-speed.</li>
            <li>Next add: Every time the ball bounces, change it to a
            random color.</li>
            <li>Next add: Every time the ball bounces, change it to a
            random size. Be sure to specify a minimum and maximum
            size.</li>
            <li>Next add: Create a <em>score</em> variable. Each time
            the ball hits the right side, increase the score.</li>
            <li>Next add: Add a taller rectangle on the left side of the
            screen to serve as the player paddle. If the ball hits the
            player, it should bounce back to the right.</li>
            <li>Look up the <a
            href="https://processing.org/reference/keyCode.html">keyPressed()</a>
            function in the Processing Reference site. In the example
            code at the bottom it shows how to check for UP and DOWN
            arrow keys. Add a keyPressed function to your code and
            modify your code so that when a player presses up, the
            player’s paddle moves up. When you press down, the player’s
            paddle moves down.</li>
            <li>Finally: add a lives variable. Start with 10 lives. When
            the ball hits the left wall (because the player missed it),
            decrease one life. If the lives go below 1, draw a red
            background color to cover the screen (which will indicate
            the player has lost).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>GOOD LUCK!</p>
            <h2 id="optional-advanced-homework">OPTIONAL Advanced
            homework</h2>
            <p>IF you are a math/computer science student or considering
            to be one, or need extra challenges, also implement:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Add a second player on the right side.</li>
            <li>Have W and S keys control the left player. UP and DOWN
            arrows control the right player.</li>
            <li>Each player should have their own starting 10
            lives.</li>
            <li>If either player misses the ball (and it hits the wall
            on their side), decrease 1.</li>
            <li>If a player’s life goes below 1, make that side of the
            screen red (showing the player has lost) and stop the ball
            from moving.</li>
            <li>IF YOU DO ALL OF THAT and need more challenge: make the
            ball get a little bit faster each time a player hits
            it.</li>
            </ol>
