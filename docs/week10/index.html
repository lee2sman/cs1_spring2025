            <blockquote>
            <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10
            December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English
            mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on
            Charles Babbage’s proposed mechanical general-purpose
            computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to
            recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure
            calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to
            be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is
            sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full
            potential of a “computing machine” and the first computer
            programmer</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Lovelace is often considered the first computer
            programmer, as she was the first to publish an algorithm
            intended for implementation on Charles Babbage’s analytical
            engine, in October 1842, intended for the calculation of
            Bernoulli numbers. Because Babbage’s machine was never
            completed to a functioning standard in her time, she never
            saw this algorithm run.</p>

            <li>1940s computers were very similar to Babbage’s
            analytical engine but instead of gears they used electronic
            circuits. To compute (in this case, calculate values), you
            would physically rewire a circuit.</li>
            <li>over time, banks of switches were introduced to allow
            you to make changes to a circuit</li>

            amongst the earliest electronic general-purpose computers

            large class of numerical problems” through
            reprogramming.</li>

            calculate artillery firing tables for the United States
            Army’s Ballistic Research Laboratory, its first program was
            a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon.</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Snyder and Betty Jean Jennings were
            responsible for developing the demonstration trajectory
            program, although Herman and Adele Goldstine took credit for
            it. ENIAC was completed in 1945 and first put to work for
            practical purposes at the end of that year</li>

            <h3 id="grace-hopper">Grace Hopper</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>She popularized the idea of machine-independent
            programming languages, which led to the development of
            COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use
            today.</li>
            <li>English words could now be translated into machine
            code.</li>
            <li>this concept was used by languages Fortran, COBOL and
            later PASCAL, Algol, BASIC</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
            <p>When Hopper recommended the development of a new
            programming language that would use entirely English words,
            she “was told very quickly that [she] couldn’t do this
            because computers didn’t understand English.” Her idea was
            not accepted for 3 years, and she published her first paper
            on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the
            company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation,
            and it was while she was working for them that her original
            compiler work was done. The program was known as the A
            compiler and its first version was A-0. <a

            <p>In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number
            is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary
            numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically 0
            (zero) and 1 (one).</p>
            <p>Binary lets us use a system of logic. Truth and False. On
            and off.</p>

            <h3 id="bits-and-bytes">Bits and Bytes</h3>
            <p>The length of a binary number is the amount of 1’s and
            0’s it has. In other words, the number of digits is called
            the <em>length</em>.</p>
            <p>Common bit-lengths of binary numbers include bits,
            nibbles, and bytes</p>
            <p>Each 1 or 0 in a binary number is called a
            <strong>bit</strong>.</p>
            <p>The <strong>byte</strong> is a unit of digital
            information that most commonly consists of eight bits,
            representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the
            number of bits used to encode a single character of text in
            a computer.</p>
            <p>A byte can hold values from 0 to 255.</p>
