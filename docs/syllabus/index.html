            <h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
            <p>This course is an introduction to computer science and
            programming as a basis for understanding computation. We
            will work with the Processing language, a flexible language
            for coding in the context of the visual arts, as well as a
            foundational tool for learning programming skills. This
            course will be adaptive to student needs for those within
            and outside of the Computer Science Major. We will begin the
            semester learning basic elements of programming along with
            coding skills and concepts. As the semester progresses
            students will propose and work on individual programming
            projects to demonstrate their knowledge and to apply
            concepts of computation to their own areas of interest and
            study.</p>

            explicitly forbids cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of
            academic dishonesty. Plagiarism is the appropriation or
            imitation of the language, ideas, and/or thoughts of another
            person and the representation of them as one’s own original
            work. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves
            with the definition of plagiarism and the acceptable methods
            of attribution.</p>

            <blockquote>
            <p>Violation of any of the above may lead to formal
            disciplinary action and the following sanctions: - Minimum
            Sanction: Failing grade on the assignment or examination.
            Maximum Sanction: Expulsion - Recommended Sanction (First
            Offense): Failing grade for the course - Recommended

            <blockquote>
            <p>Students who have any questions or doubts about whether
            any activity is academically permissible should check with
            the instructor.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Plagiarism and cheating are taken seriously. You will be
            held accountable for Purchase’s <a

            <h3 id="class-policy-on-collaboration">Class policy on
            Collaboration</h3>
            <p>I support collaborative learning with some important
            caveats.</p>
            <p>Coding can be difficult, and struggling with the material
            is part of the learning process. Students are allowed to
            collaborate to learn from each other. Do not collaborate in
            order to simply find out a solution to a project. Each
            participant should contribute approximately equally, and
            what you turn in should be your own. Copying a solution from
            another student, even if you change a few minor things such
            as variable names, is not a collaboration. You may help
            someone learn something, but you can not tell them what to
            code. If you have questions about collaboration or academic
            integrity, get in touch with me via email, talk with me
            before or after class, or come to office hours.</p>
            <h2 id="tutoring-support">Tutoring Support</h2>
            <p>All students at Purchase College can take advantage of
            our tutoring services in the Learning Center and the
            Einstein Corner. This semester these will be held online via
            Zoom. These are free, 45-minute, peer-to-peer tutoring
            sessions in a variety of subjects and in writing across the
            disciplines. I encourage you to take advantage of this
            service to help you excel in this class, as well as your
            other courses. Please visit the <a
            href="https://www.purchase.edu/offices/learning-center/index.php">Learning
            Center</a> and <a

            has tutors for CS1 classes.</p>
            <h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
            <p>You will have in-class and outside of class coursework
            and homework in the form of code sketches and projects. All
            work is to be submitted on time before our class. For the
            most part, I am checking that you did your work, that you
            wrestled with challenges, and tried to work through them.
            That is more important to me than that you got the exact
            right answer. <strong>It is always better to turn in
            SOMETHING even if you can’t totally get your code to work,
            than to not turn in anything at all</strong>. That way, I
            can see that you were working.</p>
            <h2 id="accessiblity-statement">Accessiblity Statement</h2>
            <p>It is my goal that this class be an accessible and
            welcoming experience for all students, including those with
            disabilities. You are welcome to talk to me at any point in
            the semester about course design concerns, but it is always
            best if we can talk as soon as possible about the need for
            any modifications. The Office of Disability Resources
            collaborates directly with students who identify documented
            disabilities to create accommodation plans, including
            testing accommodations, in order for students to access
            course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those
            students who may require accommodations, please call or
            email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035,
            odr@purchase.edu.</p>
            <h2 id="tentative-nature-of-syllabus">Tentative Nature of
            syllabus</h2>
            <p>If needed, this syllabus and the course outline may be
            revised to better suit the class. Students are responbile
            for keeping up with any changes distributed via email or in
            class. The most up to date syllabus will always be linked
            from Moodle.</p>

            <h2 id="community-health-during-covid-19">COMMUNITY HEALTH
            DURING COVID-19:</h2>
            <p>To ensure that each of us has a healthy and safe learning
            experience, all students are required to remain informed and
            follow Purchase College Policy and/or any departmental,
            local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations for
            attending classes on campus and in a remote learning
            environment.</p>
            <p>Within courses that involve in-person contact, all
            students, faculty members, staff, and visitors are required
            to adhere to the expectations outlined on the College’s
            COVID-19 website. Failure to comply with requirements
            (e.g. wearing masks, maintaining social distancing where
            applicable) will result in the request to leave the
            classroom for that in-person class session. Students may
            also be referred to the Office of Community Standards.</p>
            <p>Do not enter campus buildings if you test positive for or
            are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19. Contact your
            faculty and Health Services if you need to miss class
            because of COVID-19 symptoms or a positive COVID-19 test
            result. The conservatory/school will address on a case by
            case basis student absences due to COVID-19, while awaiting
            test results, or during quarantine.</p>
            <h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
            <p>Please don’t miss class. We only have one of these a
            week!</p>
            <p>Learning programming is a cumulative effort. More than
            most other courses each of our classes will build on what
            you have learned in previous classes. Missing class sets you
            back in this process. It is important that you attend every
            class.</p>
            <p>Here’s my policy: Three absences will lower your grade by
            one letter. (i.e. an A will became a B). With each
            additional unexcused absences, the grade will drop an
            additional unit for each absence. I will take attendance at
            the beginning of class, often with a brief check-in quiz. If
            you miss the quiz or are more than 15 minutes late, that is
            the equivalence of an absence. If there is an emergency or
            otherwise extenuating circumstance that prevents you from
            attending class, please email me.</p>
            <p>We will be covering critical concepts and working on code
            and projects in-class and you are responsible for reviewing
            our class site and reaching out to your peers outside of
            class time to catch up on what you have missed.</p>
            <h2 id="programming-language-choice">Programming Language
            choice</h2>
            <p>There are countless forums and debates dedicated to what
            programming language you should learn first. The language
            you choose doesn’t matter as much as you may think. Instead,
            it’s important to learn basic concepts of coding. We will be
            primarily focused on the Processing language, built on top
            of the Java language. Java is widely used and can run on
            almost any computer. Processing provides a friendly coding
            development environment, has lots of resources for
            beginners, is capable of intensive computing tasks, provides
            a simple graphic library, and will teach you fundamental
            skills which can be applied to other languages. We may touch
            on other languages in this course including an overview of
            Java at the end of the semester. Students will have
            knowledge to be able to go on and work with almost any other
            language at the conclusion of our course.</p>
            <h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
            <p>We are all learners and educators. Your experience and
            participation is valid and necessary. I am not the sole
            source of information. You are responsible for and
            encouraged to be in charge of your own education. Leap forth
            into areas of interest. Teach with and learn from
            others.</p>
            <p>Please hold me accountable and point out areas that need
            to be improved.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Help each other out. Ask lots of questions of me and
            your fellow students.</li>
            <li>Learning to program is failure followed by success.</li>
            <li>If you are feeling left behind, stuck, or frustrated in
            any way, please let me know immediately. I am here to
            help.</li>
            <li>Sleep enough hours. Good sleep will get you through
            college, reduce stress, help you do well in class, and feel
            better. And it’s free.</li>

            <p>It is my intent to lead a course that serves students
            from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our
            varied life experiences may enter the classroom as a
            resource, strength and benefit. I will address you by your
            name and pronouns and make arrangements to address
            disabilities or religious needs.</p>
            <p>Free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and
            expected but I will not tolerate harassment, including
            threats of violence, deliberate intimidation, unwelcome
            sexual attention, and offensive comments related to gender
            identity and expression, sexual orientation, race,

            religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill
            level, occupation, or background. During class discussion
            and critique we aim to speak and to listen, be mindful and
            generous in our interactions, and make everyone feel
            heard.</p>
