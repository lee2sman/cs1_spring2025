            <h3 id="arrays-of-objects">Arrays of objects</h3>
            <p>Several weeks ago we built Frogger in class. We created a
            Car class and then built a number of car objects (car0,
            car1, car2, etc). What do these objects have in common?</p>
            <p>This is a perfect use case for an array. Especially if we
            want to make a large number of cars.</p>
            <p>Let’s re-use our car class:</p>
            <pre><code>class Car {
  float x;
  float y;
  float xspeed;
  color c;
  
  Car(float tempX, float tempY, float tempXspeed, color tempC){
    c = tempC;
    x = tempX;
    y = tempY;
    xspeed = tempXspeed;
  }
  
  void display(){
    rectMode(CENTER);
    stroke(0);
    fill(c);
    rect(x, y, 20, 10);
  }
  
  void move(){
    x = x + xspeed;
    
    if (x &gt; width){
      x = 0;
    }
    if (x &lt; 0){
      x = width;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
            <p>Let’s say we have 2 cars.</p>
            <p>Our main code:</p>
            <pre><code>Car car0, car1;

void setup(){
  size(500,500);
  car0 = new Car(100,150,1,color(100,0,100));
  car1 = new Car(300,230,2,color(220,0,120));
}

void draw(){
  background(255);
  car0.display();
  car0.move();
  car1.display();
  car1.move();
}</code></pre>
            <p>What happens if we have more than 2 cars. What if we have
            10 cars? 30 cars?</p>
            <p>It would be a lot easier if we didn’t have type in all of
            the cars individually.</p>
            <pre><code>Car[] cars = new Car[20]; //an array of 20 cars

void setup(){
  size(500,500);
  
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; cars.length; i++){
    cars[i] = new Car(random(width),random(height),random(2),color(random(255)));
  }
}

void draw(){
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; cars.length; i++){
    cars[i].display();
    cars[i].move();
    }
}</code></pre>
            <h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
            <p>Processing comes with a Debugger.</p>
            <p>What’s a bug?</p>

            <li>Turn on the debugger (Debug menu or click the Moth
            icon)</li>
            <li>Click on the line where you want to set a breakpoint (a
            pause when running the code)</li>
            <li>Choose <em>Set Breakpoint</em> from the Debug menu</li>
            <li>Run your code. It will pause at the breakpoint and show
            your variables.</li>
            <li>You can hit step to move one line of code, or continue
            to run until the next breakpoint</li>

            Processing folder to see builtin variables.</li>

            <p>A few weeks ago we looked at diagrams of finite state
            machines.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>Today, we will code one.</p>
            <p>At its core, the finite state machine are a series of
            functions with different states. You can transition between
            these states. And you can never be in more than one state at
            a time.</p>
            <pre><code>void draw(){
  if (state == &quot;sleeping&quot;){
    sleeping();
  } else if (state == &quot;laughing&quot;){
    laughing();
  } else if (state == &quot;eating&quot;){
    eating();
  } else {
    sitting();
  }

            <p>Prototype of virtual pet due.</p>
            <p>Your prototype must include: - 1. flowchart of finite
            state machine and 2. your code - Code all states from your
            submitted finite state machine flowchart. <strong>Your code
            must reflect on the states and triggers from your finite
            state machine flowchart</strong> - Implementation of all
            triggers and states (triggers are the events that transition
            between states) - compelling visuals of the pet to accompany
            each of its states (consider how you can animate as well) -
            completion of interactivity and timers between states</p>
            <p>Grading Rubric for final of virtual pet project:</p>
            <h4 id="code">Code</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Your project’s code should be well-commented. Variables,
            functions and class names should be clear. Classes should be
            on their own separate tab.</li>
            <li>Your coding should be efficient. Break your code into
            meaningful chunks using functions and classes. Rather than
            repeat code, use loops. Consider how arrays might help your
            code.</li>
            <li>Your code should work!</li>
            <li>Don’t hard code numbers. Use variables, width, height -
            for example - to make your code function on different
            computers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="idea">Idea</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Your software should be accompanied by a description
            (more than a paragraph, less than a page. What is the idea?
            How did you approach it? What challenges did you have? How
            did you solve it? These are example questions. Feel free to
            add additional information.</li>
            <li>Did you base your functionality on other virtual pets,
            animals, Aibo, something else?</li>
            <li>What feedback did you receive on your prototype? What
            changes did you make based on that feedback?</li>
            <li>Your originality will be judged. Do not copy projects
            already found online.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="functionality-and-design">Functionality and
            Design</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Is it clear how to use and navigate your virtual pet?
            Remember K.I.S.S. principles (<em>“Keep It Simple,
            Stupid!”</em>)</li>
            <li>How do you interact with it?</li>
            <li>Does the program flow (of your finite state machine)
            make logical sense?</li>
            <li>Do the aesthetics suit the concept? Is it engaging more
            than a minute? Is the interaction compelling for users?</li>
            <li>How does the virtual pet show that it’s passing
            time?</li>
            <li><strong>A complete virtual pet must include both timers
            as well as interactivity (mouse or keys).</strong></li>
            </ul>
