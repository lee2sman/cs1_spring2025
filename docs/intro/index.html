            <h3 id="what-is-processing">What is Processing?</h3>
            <p>Processing is a programming language and the name of a
            programming environment. It was designed to act as a
            flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how
            to code. Processing was initiated by Casey Reas and Ben Fry
            at the MIT Media Lab in 2001, and was based on the language
            Design By Numbers led by John Maeda at the lab.</p>
            <p>Processing uses the Java language with some
            simplifications and added features. It is a maintained free,
            libre, and open source language.</p>
            <h3 id="getting-processing">Getting Processing</h3>
            <p>Processing can be downloaded for free or donation from <a
            href="https://processing.org/download/">processing.org/download</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="an-intro-to-the-processing-ide">An intro to the
            Processing IDE</h3>
            <p>IDE stands for Integrated Desktop Environment. Processing
            is both the name of the language as well as the name of the
            IDE software.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="../images/ide.png" alt="Processing IDE" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Processing IDE</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In the center is the <strong>code editor</strong>. This
            is where you write your code. There are line numbers running
            down the left side. Line numbers are helpful when figuring
            out where mistakes lie.</p>
            <p>Along the top are two buttons. The button with the
            <strong>play</strong> symbol compiles and runs your code
            sketch. The <strong>stop</strong> button stops your code
            from running, and closes the running sketch’s window.</p>
            <p>The button in the top right that looks like a butterfly
            is the <strong>Debugger</strong>. It’s a tool to help you
            de-bug your code. To the right you’ll see the word
            <em>Java</em> reminding us that we are using the Java
            engine.</p>
            <p>In the bottom there is the <strong>console</strong>. Text
            that we specify prints out here, and all errors will be
            printed here as well. This is often the first place we look
            after our code sketch crashes.</p>
            <h3 id="coordinate-system">Coordinate system</h3>
            <p>How do we tell the computer where to draw on the screen?
            We use a coordinate system. In a cartesian coordinate
            system, named for Renee Descartes, we use numerical
            coordinates to specify positions on the screen. You may
            remember using such a system in middle and high school math
            classes. We created graphs with a X and Y axis. The point
            0,0 was in the center of the page.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="../images/coordinates.svg" alt="coordinates" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">coordinates</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In Processing, 0,0 is at the top left of our window. As
            we move right, X increases. As we move down, Y increases.
            The top left point is 0,0.</p>
            <h3 id="setup">setup</h3>
            <p>Setup runs once at the onset of your program. Everything
            that we want to run once at the beginning of our program
            goes between the <strong>{</strong> and <strong>}</strong>
            curly brackets of our <code>setup()</code> function.</p>
            <p>We will be drawing to a digital canvas, which has a width
            and height that we specify. These are defined in pixels.</p>
            <pre><code>void setup() {
  size(500,500);
}</code></pre>
            <p>This is a function. We will come back to what that means
            later, but in the meantime, it is important to note that
            everything that we want to happen once when our program
            begins takes place inside of setup().</p>
            <p>Our program runs sequentially, each line running one
            after another in order. Each line ends in a semicolon.</p>
            <p>In our program, it starts to run. It finds the setup()
            section and looks for instructions inside. This line tells
            Processing to create a canvas 500 pixels wide by 500 pixels
            high.</p>
            <h3 id="draw">draw</h3>
            <pre><code>void draw(){
  //Code to happen in a loop forever!
}</code></pre>
            <p>The draw function starts immediately after the code in
            <code>setup()</code> runs, and it happens in a loop. The
            entire <code>draw()</code> loop runs approximately 60 times
            a second, though this can vary depending on your computer’s
            speed/efficiency. At the bottom of the draw loop contained
            in the <strong>{</strong> and <strong>}</strong> brackets it
            jumps back to the beginning of the draw loop and continues
            to run again, infinitely, until you click stop or close the
            web page.</p>
            <h3 id="drawing-shapes">Drawing shapes</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>rectangle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With a rectangle, you specify the starting x and y
            location, then the width, finally followed by the height. In
            the example below, we are drawing a rectangle at x position
            100 and y position 200, with a width of 40 and tall heigh of
            300.</p>
            <pre><code>rect(100,200,40,300);</code></pre>
            <ul>
            <li>ellipse</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An ellipse is similar to a rectangle. You specify an X, Y
            then width and (optionally) a height. But this time the
            circle will be centered on the specified x and y
            position.</p>
            <pre><code>ellipse(100,200,40,300);</code></pre>
            <p>How does this look different from the rectangle?</p>
            <ul>
            <li>line</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A line is quite simple. You specify the starting x and y,
            and the ending x and y positions.</p>
            <pre><code>line(20,60,300,380);</code></pre>
            <ul>
            <li>triangle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A triangle is like a more advanced lined. You specify
            three sets of x, y coordinates and a triangle appears
            connecting those points.</p>
            <pre><code>triangle(20,20,120,20,70,120);</code></pre>
            <ul>
            <li>point</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I rarely use this but it’s quite simple. Just specify a
            single x, y pair.</p>
            <pre><code>point(100,100);</code></pre>
            <h3 id="iterative-design-and-code-sketching">Iterative
            design and code sketching</h3>
            <p>Processing uses the concept of a software sketchbook, and
            makes it easy to write code, test (by hitting play), and
            adding more. In this manner, we write some code, test it,
            write some more code, test it, write some more……etc, in a
            loop, until we get to a finished version that we are happy
            with. This is known as an <em>iterative process</em>. It is
            a normal process of coding to start simple and and
            continually add to and refine your work.</p>
            <h2 id="color">Color</h2>
            <p>A page’s background color can be specified</p>
            <pre><code>background(120);</code></pre>
            <p>Before a shape, specify color with fill. A single number
            between 0 and 255 gives a grey value from 0 (black) to 255
            (white).</p>
            <pre><code>fill(120); </code></pre>
            <p>Or to get a color, specify it’s R, G and B values.</p>
            <pre><code>fill(255, 0, 0);</code></pre>
            <p><strong>REMEMBER: Color values go from 0 to 255. 0 is
            black, 255 is white.</strong></p>
            <figure>
            <img src="../images/color.jpg" alt="color wheel" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">color wheel</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><strong>The line order matters!</strong> Specify your
            fill color before the shape you draw.</p>
            <pre><code>fill(0,255,255);
rect(100,200,150,50);</code></pre>

            <h3 id="the-reference">The Reference</h3>
            <p>How do you know what commands are available in
            Processing?</p>
            <p>The <a
            href="https://processing.org/reference">Reference</a> is the
            complete list of available commands to use in Processing. It
            is broken down by category, and there is also a search
            feature. Use it to learn how to properly use a particular
            command.</p>
            <p><em>We will use the reference so much in this class that
            it is recommended you consider adding it to your bookmarks
            bar.</em></p>
            <h3 id="commenting">Commenting</h3>
            <p>It’s considered good practice to leave notes for yourself
            in your code. This is especially true in tricky code
            sections, or any time you think it will help you understand
            what your code is doing, or if you share your code with
            someone else. The clearer your comments, the easier it will
            be for you to understand your code when you open it again in
            the future.</p>
            <p>To make a comment, put two <code>//</code> at the
            beginning of the line.</p>
            <pre><code>//This is a comment</code></pre>
            <p>You can also do multiple line comments. <em>Note: I
            rarely use this.</em></p>
            <pre><code>/* this
is a multiple line
comment
*/</code></pre>
            <h3 id="console-error-messages">Console / Error
            Messages</h3>
            <figure>
            <img src="../images/error.png" alt="error in console" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">error in console</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The console tells you when you made a mistake. It points
            out the line where it thinks the mistake was made and gives
            you an explanation of what you did wrong. These error
            messages can be confusing when you first are learning how to
            code. Over time, you will learn to understand what they mean
            and how they will help you fix your code.</p>
            <p>We also use the <code>print()</code> command in our code
            to print things in the console for use in debugging. Stay
            tuned for more info on this in our next class.</p>

            Class Goals</h3>
            <p>Write a paragraph or two on your goals for the class.
            What do you want to get out of this class? What are your
            hopes or fears in this course? What looks exciting? What
            looks challenging? It’s okay to write on other questions as
            well.</p>
            <h2 id="assignment-2">Assignment 2</h2>
            <p>Part A. Design an abstract or simplified face composed of
            10-20 basic shapes (rectangles, ellipses, lines, triangles,
            polygons, stars). Look at the links and images below as a
            reference. Think about all the different faces we’ve looked
            at and how you can construct a face both human or
            non-human.</p>
            <p>Before you begin coding, sketch this face out either on
            paper or in your software of choice, or in a notebook, and
            be prepared to share at our next session. Also have your
            face translated into processing code. Make sure your sketch
            size is set at 500 pixels x 500 pixels. UPLOAD THIS SKETCH
            to Brightspace by zipping/compressing.</p>
            <p>Part A is due next week.</p>
            <p>Part B. Copy this sketch and make another one using your
            first face as starter code. This second face should
            integrate interaction, with mouse movements and/or
            keypresses. Consider having colors change, shapes change
            scale, move, or other ideas you come up with. UPLOAD THIS
            SKETCH to Brightspace by zipping/compressing. <strong>Part B
            is DUE in two weeks, on Feb 11</strong></p>
