### What is Processing?

Processing is a programming language and the name of a programming environment. It was designed to act as a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code. Processing was initiated by Casey Reas and Ben Fry at the MIT Media Lab in 2001, and was based on the language Design By Numbers led by John Maeda at the lab.

Processing uses the Java language with some simplifications and added features. It is a maintained free, libre, and open source language. 

### Getting Processing

Processing can be downloaded for free or donation from [processing.org/download](https://processing.org/download/).

### An intro to the Processing IDE

IDE stands for Integrated Desktop Environment. Processing is both the name of the language as well as the name of the IDE software. 

![Processing IDE](ide.png)

In the center is the **code editor**. This is where you write your code. There are line numbers running down the left side. Line numbers are helpful when figuring out where mistakes lie.

Along the top are two buttons. The button with the **play** symbol compiles and runs your code sketch. The **stop** button stops your code from running, and closes the running sketch's window.

The button in the top right that looks like a butterfly is the **Debugger**. It's a tool to help you de-bug your code. To the right you'll see the word *Java* reminding us that we are using the Java engine. 

In the bottom there is the **console**. Text that we specify prints out here, and all errors will be printed here as well. This is often the first place we look after our code sketch crashes.

### Coordinate system

How do we tell the computer where to draw on the screen? We use a coordinate system. In a cartesian coordinate system, named for Renee Descartes, we use numerical coordinates to specify positions on the screen. You may remember using such a system in middle and high school math classes. We created graphs with a X and Y axis. The point 0,0 was in the center of the page.

![coordinates](coordinates.svg)

In Processing, 0,0 is at the top left of our window. As we move right, X increases. As we move down, Y increases. The top left point is 0,0.

### setup

Setup runs once at the onset of your program. Everything that we want to run once at the beginning of our program goes between the **{** and **}** curly brackets of our ```setup()``` function.

We will be drawing to a digital canvas, which has a width and height that we specify. These are defined in pixels.

```
void setup() {
  size(500,500);
}
```

This is a function. We will come back to what that means later, but in the meantime, it is important to note that everything that we want to happen once when our program begins takes place inside of setup(). 

Our program runs sequentially, each line running one after another in order. Each line ends in a semicolon.

In our program, it starts to run. It finds the setup() section and looks for instructions inside. This line tells Processing to create a canvas 500 pixels wide by 500 pixels high.

### draw

```
void draw(){
  //Code to happen in a loop forever!
}
```

The  draw function starts immediately after the code in ```setup()``` runs, and it happens in a loop. The entire ```draw()``` loop runs approximately 60 times a second, though this can vary depending on your computer's speed/efficiency. At the bottom of the draw loop contained in the **{** and **}** brackets it jumps back to the beginning of the draw loop and continues to run again, infinitely, until you click stop or close the web page.

### Drawing shapes

- rectangle

With a rectangle, you specify the starting x and y location, then the width, finally followed by the height. In the example below, we are drawing a rectangle at x position 100 and y position 200, with a width of 40 and tall heigh of 300.

```
rect(100,200,40,300);
```

- ellipse

An ellipse is similar to a rectangle. You specify an X, Y then width and (optionally) a height. But this time the circle will be centered on the specified x and y position.

```
ellipse(100,200,40,300);
```

How does this look different from the rectangle?

- line

A line is quite simple. You specify the starting x and y, and the ending x and y positions.

```
line(20,60,300,380);
```

- triangle

A triangle is like a more advanced lined. You specify three sets of x, y coordinates and a triangle appears connecting those points.

```
triangle(20,20,120,20,70,120);
```

- point

I rarely use this but it's quite simple. Just specify a single x, y pair.

```
point(100,100);
```

### Iterative design and code sketching

Processing uses the concept of a software sketchbook, and makes it easy to write code, test (by hitting play), and adding more. In this manner, we write some code, test it, write some more code, test it, write some more......etc, in a loop, until we get to a finished version that we are happy with. This is known as an *iterative process*. It is a normal process of coding to start simple and and continually add to and refine your work.

## Color

A page's background color can be specified

```
background(120);
```

Before a shape, specify color with fill. A single number between 0 and 255 gives a grey value from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

```
fill(120); 
```

Or to get a color, specify it's R, G and B values.

```
fill(255, 0, 0);
```

**REMEMBER: Color values go from 0 to 255. 0 is black, 255 is white.**

![color wheel](color.jpg)

**The line order matters!** Specify your fill color before the shape you draw. 
```
fill(0,255,255);
rect(100,200,150,50);
```

#### In-class Exercise

Make your face!

### The Reference

How do you know what commands are available in Processing?

The [Reference](https://processing.org/reference) is the complete list of available commands to use in Processing. It is broken down by category, and there is also a search feature. Use it to learn how to properly use a particular command.

*We will use the reference so much in this class that it is recommended you consider adding it to your bookmarks bar.*

### Commenting

It's considered good practice to leave notes for yourself in your code. This is especially true in tricky code sections, or any time you think it will help you understand what your code is doing, or if you share your code with someone else. The clearer your comments, the easier it will be for you to understand your code when you open it again in the future.

To make a comment, put two ```//``` at the beginning of the line.

```
//This is a comment
```

You can also do multiple line comments. *Note: I rarely use this.*

```
/* this
is a multiple line
comment
*/
```

### Console / Error Messages

![error in console](error.png)

The console tells you when you made a mistake. It points out the line where it thinks the mistake was made and gives you an explanation of what you did wrong. These error messages can be confusing when you first are learning how to code. Over time, you will learn to understand what they mean and how they will help you fix your code.

We also use the ```print()``` command in our code to print things in the console for use in debugging. Stay tuned for more info on this in our next class.

## Assignment 1

### Writing Assignment: Class Goals

Write a paragraph or two on your goals for the class. What do you want to get out of this class? What are your hopes or fears in this course? What looks exciting? What looks challenging? It's okay to write on other questions as well. 

## Assignment 2

Part A.
Design an abstract or simplified face composed of 10-20 basic shapes (rectangles, ellipses, lines, triangles, polygons, stars). Look at the links and images below as a reference. Think about all the different faces we've looked at and how you can construct a face both human or non-human.

Before you begin coding, sketch this face out either on paper or in your software of choice, or in a notebook, and be prepared to share at our next session. Also have your face translated into processing code. Make sure your sketch size is set at 500 pixels x 500 pixels. UPLOAD THIS SKETCH to Brightspace by zipping/compressing.

Part A is due next week.

Part B. Copy this sketch and make another one using your first face as starter code. This second face should integrate interaction, with mouse movements and/or keypresses. Consider having colors change, shapes change scale, move, or other ideas you come up with. UPLOAD THIS SKETCH to Brightspace by zipping/compressing. **Part B is DUE in two weeks, on Feb 11**
