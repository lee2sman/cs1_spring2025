Note: We will take breaks at least once an hour
 
## Today's Schedule

* Ungraded quiz
* warmup: flag
* createShape()
* Variables
* Random
* Review HW
* Conditionals
* If we have time: bouncing a ball

## Make a flag

Choose one from the list and work on it solo or with a partner.

## Today's Goals

Today's goals are to understand variables, conditionals and loops. You should understand variables completely, including types. 

You should also be able to program your own simple video game. We will start to build Pong.

How does this fit into the plan for the semester? Variables and Conditionals (aka "If Statements") are foundational knowledge for all programming languages. With this basic knowledge you can move on to more advanced concepts in programming.

## Defaults

### Size default

By default, Processing will create a window of 100 by 100 pixels if you do not set the window size with ```size(x, y)```. 

### Control flow default
If you do not specify a setup() or draw() function the code will execute once. 

### Background default

The background, if not specified, will be grey aka ```background(120)```.

## Custom Shapes

Last week we covered rectangles, ellipses, points, lines. There are other [shapes](https://processing.org/reference/#shape) available such as triangles, quads and arcs.

But you can also make your own custom shape, filled or empty. You do so by starting the shape, declaring all the points (similar to fill-in-the-dots), then closing the shape.

Example

```
beginShape();
vertex(20, 20);
vertex(40, 20);
vertex(40, 40);
vertex(60, 40);
vertex(60, 60);
vertex(20, 60);
endShape(CLOSE);
```

### Variables

A variable is a container to hold a value in memory. 

A variable's value can be altered.

Example:

the variable ```age``` increases by 1 each year on your birthday.

### Types of Variables

Variables are declared (aka created) by first stating their type, then their name. They must start with a letter and may only consist of letters, numbers and underscores (e.g. ```student_age``` ).

The type of a variable indicates what you will be storing in it.

```int```, an integer. For whole numbers such as -12, 0, 340, 32.

```float```, a floating point number, more commonly called a *decimal.* Examples: 0.005, 75.30, 33333.33333334.

```boolean```, a variable that can either be true or false.

Other variable types that we won't use much in this class but are good to know include char, byte, short, long, double.

#### Declare and Initializing variables

You create a variable when you **declare** it.

You set the value of a variable when you **initialize** it.

Note: I've bolded these words because these are their official names.


Declaring and initializing in two separate steps:

```
int age; //declares a variable age
age = 20; //initializes the variable age
```

**OR**

Declaring and initializing in a single step:

```
int age = 20; //declare and initialize the variable
```

**When should you use a variable? When you have to rewrite a particular value multiple times.**

### Adding a variable to itself

Example:

Moving a circle to the right.

```
int circleX = 20;

void draw(){
  ellipse(circleX, 50, 20, 20);
  circleX = circleX + 1; //adds 1 to circleX each time it runs
}
```

In this example, take a look at the line ```circleX = circleX + 1```. The single equal sign indicates that we are setting a value to a variable. We evaluate the final result of the calculations to the right of the equal sign and set the variable to the left of that equal sign.

### Built-in system variables

* width, height (set by *size*)
* mouseX, mouseY (location of mouse's x and y coordinates)
* frameCount (the number of times draw has run)
* displayWidth, displayHeight (size of your screen)
* key (last key pressed)
* keyCode (number representing a keypress)
* keyPressed (a true/false boolean)
* mousePressed ( a true/false boolean)


### Let's get random

```
random(min,max);
```

**Important: random is a float by default!**

```
float crazyNum = random(1,300); //picks a float between 1 and 300
```

To get an integer, **cast** it (aka converting). Casting is the process of converting between types.

```
int crazyNum = int(random(1,300));
```

Check the use of nested parenthesis to indicate the order of execution. Start in the inner parenthesis and work out.

Why do we have different variable types?

* Because they take up different amounts of memory
* Because we want precision

Not every language has these same goals.

## Debugging with println

When working with variables, it can be easy to get confused. Many times you are expecting certain variables but you're seeing something else on your screen. One way to try to figure out what is going on is just to print out what value your variable is currently set to.

Example:

```
float x;

function setup(){
  size(500,500);
}

function draw(){
  x = random(500);
  ellipse(x,250,30,30);
  println("x is currently: "+x); 
  //this prints out the text and the current value of x
}
```

## Conditionals

Conditionals are yes/no questions! Depending on the answer, there may be follow-up code that is executed.

**IF** *this* is true, *then* do this!

```
if (mouseX < 100){
  println("Your cursor is on the left.")
}
```

### Choices

* If, Else, Elif

Example with else:

```
if (candles < 20){
  println("Let's buy a box of candles for the birthday cake");
} else {
  println("I'm over it. Let's just buy one of those number candles.");
}
```

Example with multiple options using else if:


```
if (age > 64){
    println("You can retire.");
} else if (age > 18) {
    println("You can vote.");
} else {
    println("You're in primary school.");
}
```

These are very limited options.


### Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT)

#### AND

"If this is true AND that is true..."

And is ```&&```

Example

```
if ((mouseX > 0) && (mouseX < width)){
  println("Our mouse is on the screen");
} else {
  println("The mouse is offscreen");
}

```

#### OR

"If this is true OR that is true..."

OR is ```||```

Press shift + the key above ENTER, on most keyboards.

Example:

```
if ((temperature < 32) || (temperature > 100)){
  println("This weather is really annoying!");
}
```

#### Not

Not is ```!```

Example:

```
if (!mousePressed) {
//this means "if you are NOT pressing the mouse"
  background(255);
} else {
  background(0);
}
```

## Programming Homework

### Randomized face assignment

* Start with the face you created for homework previously, or begin a new face.
* This second face should feature at least 10 variables so that things like face shape, hair color, nose size, eyeball direction, eyebrows, size of mouth, tongue sticking out, etc all change differently each time you run the sketch. You should create these as global variables that you declare before setup.
* **Important: you usually declare a variable before setup, then set a variable equal to a random number inside setup (only happens once), but then draw a shape with that variable in the draw() function (happens forever).**
* You may want to add variables to change things like color, x and y location. You could also use mouseX and mouseY .
* Add a void mousePressed(){ } function that changes variables randomly when you click the mouse. Make sure to choose starting and stopping numbers that make sense for random. random(low,high).
* UPLOAD THIS SKETCH to Brightspace by zipping/compressing.
* Minimal example of a cyclops face (in other words, not a complete face!) can be downloaded, unzipped on Brightspace in the assignment. Then move the folder into your sketchbook and you can open it up and try it out in Processing.
