This course is an introduction to computer science and programming as a basis for understanding computation. We will work with the Processing language, a flexible language for coding in the context of the visual arts, as well as a foundational tool for learning programming skills. This course will be adaptive to student needs for those within and outside of the Computer Science Major. We will begin the semester learning basic elements of programming along with coding skills and concepts. As the semester progresses students will propose and work on individual programming projects to demonstrate their knowledge and to apply concepts of computation to their own areas of interest and study.

AVIDAC stands for "Argonne Version of the Institute's Digital Automatic Computer" and was based on computer architecture developed by mathematician John von Neumann. *[Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVIDAC#/media/File:Living_Large_--_Argonne's_First_Computer_(8056998342).jpg)*
